## Step 1: Database Setup and Data Models ✅

### Tasks:
1. Install MongoDB dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install mongodb mongoose
   ```
2. Set up MongoDB connection in `src/lib/mongodb.ts`
3. Create Mongoose schemas:
   - `HumanSOP`: Store original markdown content
   - `AgentSOP`: Store processed JSON with metadata
   - `ChatHistory`: Track all interactions
   - `ChangeProposal`: Store suggested improvements
   - `User`: Basic user model (for future auth)

### File Structure:
```
src/
├── lib/
│   └── mongodb.ts
└── models/
    ├── HumanSOP.ts
    ├── AgentSOP.ts
    ├── ChatHistory.ts
    ├── ChangeProposal.ts
    └── User.ts
```

### Verification:
- [x] MongoDB connection successful (`npm run test-db` shows "Connected to MongoDB")
- [x] Test CRUD operations for each model using a test script (`npm run test-models`)
- [x] Verify data persistence across server restarts

**Status**: ✅ Completed on 2025-01-23

---

## Step 2: Import Existing SOPs into Database ✅

### Tasks:
1. Create migration script `scripts/migrate-sops.ts`
2. Process existing markdown files:
   - Read each file from `content/markdown/`
   - Extract metadata (title, phase number, key sections)
   - Store as HumanSOP documents
3. Generate initial AgentSOPs:
   - Create structured JSON from markdown
   - Extract key activities, deliverables, tools
   - Add searchable metadata

### Data Structure Example:
```typescript
// HumanSOP
{
  sopId: "SOP-001",
  title: "Pre-Initiate Phase",
  markdownContent: "full markdown content...",
  version: 1,
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}

// AgentSOP
{
  sopId: "SOP-001",
  title: "Pre-Initiate Phase",
  summary: "Guidelines for project pre-initiation...",
  sections: {
    objectives: [...],
    keyActivities: [...],
    deliverables: [...],
    tools: [...]
  },
  searchableContent: "concatenated searchable text",
  humanSopId: "reference to HumanSOP"
}
```

### Verification:
- [x] All 5 SOPs imported successfully
- [x] MongoDB contains 5 HumanSOP documents
- [x] MongoDB contains 5 corresponding AgentSOP documents
- [x] Can query and retrieve SOPs by ID

**Status**: ✅ Completed on 2025-01-23
- Migration script created and executed successfully
- All 5 SOPs processed and stored in MongoDB
- Both HumanSOP and AgentSOP collections populated
- Database queries tested and verified working
- SOP retrieval API endpoints functional

- Application ready for automatic AI selection
- Clean architecture prepared for Step 3 implementation

---

## Step 3: Enhance AI Integration for SOP Selection ✅

### Tasks:
1. Update `/api/chat/route.ts` to implement two-step process:
   - Tool Selection: Analyze user query against all AgentSOPs
   - Answer Generation: Use selected SOP to generate response
2. Create utility functions:
   - `selectBestSOP()`: Use GPT-4o to match query to SOP
   - `generateAnswer()`: Create response using SOP content
   - `extractChangeProposal()`: Identify gaps in SOPs
3. Implement streaming responses for better UX

### API Flow:
```typescript
// Step A: Tool Selection
const sopSummaries = await AgentSOP.find({}, 'sopId title summary');
const selectedSopId = await selectBestSOP(userQuery, sopSummaries);

// Step B: Answer Generation
const fullSOP = await AgentSOP.findOne({ sopId: selectedSopId });
const { answer, suggestedChange } = await generateAnswer(userQuery, fullSOP);
```

### Verification:
- [x] Chat endpoint successfully selects appropriate SOP
- [x] Responses accurately reflect SOP content
- [x] Test with queries for each of the 5 phases
- [x] Streaming responses work smoothly

**Status**: ✅ Completed on 2025-01-23

## Step 4: Implement Chat History and Memory ✅

### Tasks:
1. ✅ Create API endpoint `/api/chat-history/`
2. ✅ Store every interaction:
   - User query
   - Selected SOP
   - Generated answer
   - Timestamp
   - Session ID
3. ✅ Update chat UI to show conversation history
4. ✅ Add session management (using cookies/localStorage)

### Implementation Details:

#### API Endpoints Created:
- **GET `/api/chat-history?sessionId=xxx`**: Retrieves conversation history for a session
- **POST `/api/chat-history`**: Manually add messages to history (if needed)
- **PATCH `/api/chat-history?limit=N`**: Get active sessions for admin/debugging

#### Session Management:
- **localStorage Integration**: Session IDs stored persistently in browser
- **Unique Session IDs**: Format `session-{timestamp}-{random}`
- **Automatic Session Creation**: New sessions created when none exists
- **Manual Session Reset**: "New Conversation" button for fresh starts

#### Context-Aware AI:
- **Conversation Context**: Last 4 messages passed to AI for context
- **Enhanced Prompts**: AI considers conversation history when generating responses
- **Memory Across Interactions**: Follow-up questions reference previous exchanges

#### UI Enhancements:
- **Loading States**: Shows spinner while retrieving chat history
- **History Restoration**: Messages reload on page refresh
- **New Conversation Button**: Appears when messages exist, allows fresh start
- **Session Indicators**: Clear visual feedback during session initialization

### Features Implemented:
- ✅ Persistent chat sessions across page refreshes
- ✅ Full conversation history retrieval and display
- ✅ Context awareness within sessions (AI remembers previous exchanges)
- ✅ Isolated sessions with unique identifiers
- ✅ Graceful fallback when history loading fails
- ✅ Clean session reset functionality

### Code Changes:
1. **Updated `src/lib/ai-sop-selection.ts`**:
   - Added `conversationContext` parameter to `generateAnswer()`
   - Enhanced AI prompts to include conversation history
   - Context limited to last 4 messages to prevent token bloat

2. **Updated `src/app/api/chat/route.ts`**:
   - Added conversation context retrieval from existing chat history
   - Integrated context into AI answer generation process

3. **Enhanced `src/components/ChatInterfaceAI.tsx`**:
   - Added session management with localStorage persistence
   - Implemented history loading on component initialization
   - Added "New Conversation" button with proper state management
   - Enhanced loading states and error handling

4. **Utilized existing `src/app/api/chat-history/route.ts`**:
