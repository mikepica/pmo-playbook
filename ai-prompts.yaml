# AI Prompts and User-Facing Text Configuration
# 
# This file contains all prompts, descriptions, and user-facing text for the AI system.
# It works together with ai-system.yaml to provide complete AI configuration.
# 
# FILE RELATIONSHIP:
# - ai-prompts.yaml (this file): All user-customizable text and prompts
# - ai-system.yaml: Technical settings, models, and system behavior
# 
# USAGE:
# - Customize prompts and descriptions without touching technical settings
# - Switch between different prompt sets (e.g., "default" vs "technical")
# - Different users can have different prompt files
# - Easy to version control prompts separately from system config
# 
# MULTIPLE PROMPT SETS:
# You can create multiple prompt sets for different contexts:
# - "default": General PMO consultation
# - "technical": Technical implementation focused
# - "executive": High-level strategic focus
# - Add your own custom sets as needed
