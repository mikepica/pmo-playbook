  The PMO Playbook is an AI-powered assistant that helps project managers by providing intelligent access to Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). Think of it as a smart handbook that understands questions and
  provides relevant guidance from your organization's best practices.

  1. Content Storage (Database)

	  - **Human SOPs**: The original, human-readable documents written in markdown format (like Word docs but simpler). These contain detailed procedures, best practices, and guidelines for each phase of project management. Changes are versioned.
	  - **Agent SOPs:** AI-optimized versions of the Human SOPs, structured specifically for the AI to understand and search through quickly.
	  - **Projects:** Organizational project information that can be linked to relevant SOPs.
	  - **Chat History:** Stores all conversations between users and the AI assistant.
	  - **User Feedback:** Captures user suggestions and improvements for the SOPs.

  2. The Transformation Process - When a Human SOP is created or updated:
	  1. The markdown content is analyzed by a parser (like a translator)
	  2. Key information is extracted: objectives, activities, deliverables, roles, tools
	  3. This structured data becomes an Agent SOP that the AI can quickly understand
	  4. Both versions are kept in sync - when humans update SOPs, the AI versions regenerate

  3. The AI Brain (Two-Step Process) - When a user asks a question:
	  - Step A - Finding the Right SOP: The AI reviews all available SOPs and selects the most relevant one based on the question (like a librarian finding the right book)
	  - Step B - Generating the Answer: Using the selected SOP, the AI crafts a specific answer tailored to the user's question with metadata on where it found the content
	  - **Report Gap:** Users can comment on the AI response that the core team can analyze to improve the Agent processing
	  - **Feedback**: Users can also like/dislike the entry for analytics and speed.
	  - Session Management: Conversations are saved so users can continue where they left off and export threads
  4. User Interface
	  - Chat Interface: Where users type questions and receive answers, similar to ChatGPT
	  - SOP Browser: Users can directly browse and read SOPs by phase or project. SOPs nd Projects have unique URLs that can be shared directly with others
	  - Admin Panel: Where administrators can edit SOPs, review feedback, and manage content
5. Admin Panel
	- **User Feedback**: admins review and act on user reported Gaps and Feedback
		- Feedback List: Shows all user comments with status indicators (pending, ongoing, completed, closed)
		- Priority System: Color-coded priorities (high=red, medium=yellow, low=green) help admins focus on important issues
		- Conversation Context: View the full chat history that led to the feedback
		- Admin Notes: Add internal notes about how to address feedback
		- Status Tracking: Move feedback through stages as you work on improvements
	- Manage SOPs: Ability for admins to view, edit, and create SOPs
	- Manage Projects: Admins can create and edit Project documentation for viewing in the app such as Project Charters. Later will be Agentic for automated creation and updates based on SOPs and combined with PMO NDP Agent.
	- Analytics: Analytics on user usage and feedback
	- Users & Sessions: Monitors user activities
	- Legacy Proposals: AI-generated change suggestions that was deprecated and will be developed further at a later point
